##  About

**Zentro** is a modern, lightweight API Gateway designed to unify entry points for microservices. It combines the raw performance of **Go** on the backend with a sleek, responsive **React** dashboard for management and monitoring.

Whether you need dynamic routing, load balancing, or real-time traffic insights, Zentro provides a robust solution that is easy to configure and deploy.

## ✨ Features

- **🚀 High Performance:** Built with Go 1.24 and Chi router for minimal latency.
- **🔀 Dynamic Routing:** Configure routes via JSON without restarting the server.
- **⚖️ Load Balancing:** Native support for distributing traffic across multiple upstream services.
- **🛡️ Middleware & Filters:** Built-in support for authentication, rate limiting, and logging.
- **📊 Real-time Monitoring:** Live traffic visualization and metrics using Recharts.
- **💻 Modern UI:** A beautiful, responsive dashboard built with React 19, Vite, and Tailwind CSS 4.
- **🔌 Extensible:** Modular architecture allowing for custom filter and middleware integration.

## 🛠️Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Language:** [Go](https://go.dev/) (v1.24+)
- **Router:** [Chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) - lightweight, idiomatic, and composable router.
- **Utilities:** `fsnotify` for hot-reloading configurations.

### Frontend
- **Framework:** [React 19](https://react.dev/)
- **Build Tool:** [Vite 7](https://vitejs.dev/)
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **State Management:** [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)
- **Data Fetching:** [TanStack Query v5](https://tanstack.com/query/latest)
- **Visualization:** [Recharts](https://recharts.org/)
- **Icons:** [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Go**: Version 1.24 or later.
- **Node.js**: Version 20 or later (recommended for Vite 7).
- **pnpm**: Recommended package manager (or npm/yarn).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fike110/zentro.git
    cd zentro
    ```

2.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd webapp
    pnpm install
    # or npm install
    ```

3.  **Build the Frontend:**
    ```bash
    pnpm build
    # or npm run build
    ```
    This compiles the React app into the `dist` folder, which the Go backend serves.

4.  **Run the Backend:**
    Return to the root directory and use the Makefile:
    ```bash
    cd ..
    make run
    ```
    Or run manually:
    ```bash
    go run ./cmd/gateway
    ```

The API Gateway will start on `http://localhost:8080` (default), and the Management UI will be accessible at `http://localhost:8081` (or whichever port is configured).

## ⚙️ Configuration

Zentro uses JSON files for configuration, located in the `config/` directory.

- **`routes.json`**: Defines the routing rules, upstream services, and load balancing policies.
- **`consumers.json`**: Manages API consumers and authentication credentials.

Example `routes.json` snippet:
```json
[
  {
    "path": "/api/v1/users",
    "method": "GET",
    "upstream": ["http://users-service:3000"],
    "plugins": ["rate-limit", "auth"]
  }
]
```
